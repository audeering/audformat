Database
========

An audformat database consists of a **header**,
several **tables**,
and **media** files.
On hard disk all of them are stored inside a single folder.
The header is stored as a YAML file,
the tables contain labels stored in (possibly) multiple CSV files,
and the media files are usually stored in sub-folders.
Each table column is linked to a scheme and/or to a rater.
Each table row is linked to a media file,
or a specific segment in a media file.
If no links to media files are given,
the table is called miscellaneous table,
or short **misc table**.
The database is implemented as :class:`audformat.Database`.

    ``db.yaml``                 Meta information, schemes, list of raters
    ``db.<table_id>.csv``       Table with files or file segments as index
                                and columns holding annotations
    ``db.<misc_table_id>.csv``  Misc table with unspecified index
                                and columns holding annotations
    ``<folder(s)/file(s)>``     Audio/Video files referenced in the tables

The connection between the header, media files and a table
is highlighted in the following sketch:

The connection between the header and a misc table
is highlighted in the following sketch:

.. graphviz:: pics/audformat-misc-table.dot
    :alt: audformat misc table

    :caption: Connection between header definitions and misc table entries.

The annotations stored in the tables
can be accessed as :class:`pandas.DataFrame`.
The following sketch shows an example instance of a database:
